"bring it!

"[twitter.com/beeple/status/…]

"bring in the praying mantis, stat!!!! #"
"latest #siliconvalley #covid_ (#sars_cov_, #wuhan,novel #coronavirus) stats;-->twitter.com/francisjeffrey/… #santaclara co., ca, #first_in_nation, hospitals are now running out of patients. (thanks to #google, #apple, #facebook...???)~~~fj"
i’m rooting for the murder hornet honestly
maybe he wasn't entirely evil.
i need this as a random in zangarmarsh immediately #warcraft
i feel like a hornet the size of a skyscraper misses the point of why hornets are so scary... and yet at the same time is in and of itself just as scary.
fuente? está perrona la animación
esto es un trabajo para...
"

w"
insane stuff!
wtf 
"oh dear god, if someone remakes the pray mantis eating the murder hornets into one of these, i might be scared even more..."
this is terrifying lol
who’s the genius that ran right by the battle?

"jojo battle, commence in , , ..."
the global shit show is going to define your current aesthetic or iscausing the world to follow his daily infection of pixel monajeri?
plot twist: the sting of the murder hornets make you immune to corona virus.
this needs to be a movie.
how do u get things done so quickly while retaining quality
all great art throughout history was defined in the era that the artist lived.
we need siren head to save us
damn.
bro you’re so good wtf
godzilla and king kong sitting in the cinema watching this and eating popcorn!
where is sirenhead
"in south america we also have dengue, so maybe change the hornet for a mosquitoooo"
the enemy of my enemy is my friend 
"fuck, you beat me to it"
"... do i gotta be the siren head, around here?"
and we have peronismo so please can you made a monster that look likes perón?
that's will be epic
you can hear him in the background
he's taking the bus

our time has fucking come! need dat megazord power
esto sí daba miedo..
feet apart from each other of course
no matter who wins...... we lose
i'd buy tickets to watch this movie in theaters... oh wait
bring in the praying mantises!
"spoiler alert, one can only be killed by the other."
bring in the chainsaw bears
bring em in!
now this looks like a very cool monster film like whoa. might as well sit back and watch both of our hateful things in the whole world fight each other to the death. parasite vs giant hornet stinger. 
ó lá
covidfield

"fuck it, man bear pig is coming to help"
"by the power of the nd amendment, i have a fully legal claim to all of the aforementioned bears' arms, so i would much appreciate if you would peacefully hand them over before i get my lawyers involved, and sue you for all the bear arms you're worth."
tovarish!
small price to pay 

hahahahahahhahahahahaé o ano do acopalice
haushwushsushs helppppp

hmm maybe the month of february had the right idea and to burn everything
awesome!
"we need to call the,this is right up their alley"
coronavirus looks literally nasty  shit crawling my blood
"pretty sure godzilla,mothra, and rodan will be just standing back with some popcorn or hotdogs with soda. just to sit back and enjoy the show."
hold my beer
he is on his way now.
if you manage to squeeze joe exotic in there this is amillion dollar opening weekend
the power rangers movie did it first
lmfaooo aoooo 
"no
we must let these two fight it out.then we'll destroy the survivor."
ultra man!
the original one!
"""   ,   ....    """
"to save our mother earth from any alien attack
from vicious giant insects who have once again come back
we'll unleash all our forces, we won't cut them any slack
the edf deploys!"
praying mantis: hold my beer...
yyyyyyyeaaaaaahhhhhh!!!! death to hyooomanssssss!
humans watching coronavirus vs murder hornets:
"during a bomb cyclone.

nbcnews.com/news/weather/mot…"

"why isnt o, fortuna playing?"
to save our mother earth from any alien attack!
from vicious giant insects who have once again come baaaaaaaaack
and then captain disinfectant shows up (thinking like a captain planet rip) and uses his beams of light to disintegrate everything and save the day...
"yeah, you had me on this one. i had to think for a minute here. uh... what a mess: gargantuan monster creatures and a fumigating superhero with a magical cure to save a world-conscious world. inanity everywhere. i think i got it somehow.
is that don cheadle?"
wasp messed with wrong family tree
mantis wins
that was fucking metal
if only we could convince the honey bees to hire a few mantis body guards
"damn, straight up eating the head. that's brutal."
‼
holy shit
lmao this man said “hold still for a second!”
i posted the same thing and then scrolled literally one inch down and saw you beat me to it. :|
"blasted kaijus!you're suppose to fight each other not team up!in my day giant turtles & reptiles withknife heads fought each other all the time. we also wore onion tied to our belts which was the style at the time. now to take a ferry it cost a nickel, and in those days..."
"beeple has been doing one of these everyday for the lastdays.

dude’s a beast."
"he's a freelance maniac.

heard a story how his wife was going into labor and he made her wait to finish his daily render.

i can't even brush my teeth forconsecutive days."
"cliff you want an intro? 

you should see some of his work in vr. ported a bunch of his projects tolast year!"
we need godzilla now more than ever!
there was an old lady who swallowed a fly…
wow who made this it’s amazing  funny !!!
i would watch this movie.
the hornets are not a threat.
how i can buy a image from you?

"pc only, it takes way too much work to optimize them enough for quest"

depois de julho.
nye godzilla vs king kong ser jo fantastisk ut!! 
"ikke sant! tbh, gleder meg skikkelig til å se den når den kommer ut, ble utrolig hyped etter vi så den forrige"
"so d cinema?

with the prevalence of streaming and home theaters it's likely that cinemas will have to default towards giving something extra in order to differentiate themselves and give people a reason to go."
earth is cancelled if this happens
só para fechar o ano com chave de ouro
edf
¿esto es mayo sorpréndeme?
"plot twist:
they end up merging, creating the dreaded corona hornets."

it's time for justice.

"thisguy, he’s kind of a big deal"

i’m getting jojo vibes from that clip


"so like if we survive this wholeyear can we start making monster films and horror films based off the things we dealt with like this, cuz that would be amazing"
the creativity of coronavirus is cool

"

yewtu.be/watch?v=cphtkun…
y e s
where are all the republican politicians and reopen squad behind the virus aka #virusminions #covidiots
fantastic
"i hope covid wins, save the bees"
the battle of the century.
we need to see the fight!
que buen gusto por la chucha
"beeple rules. his special blend ofvariants of cynicism really add a delightful flavor of despair to my days. (this sounds like a criticism, it is not. :d )"
"dancing?
i dunno."
"honestly, it's mad anxiety"

earth isn't playing nice anymore.

jajaja:u


who made this?????
dónde está rita en todo eso? que venga megazord.
"this is superb! i am an entomologist at the university of wisconsin - la crosse interested in cultural entomology, particularly insects in art. would it be possible to get a copy of this marvel to share with my students and when i give talks?

barrett (barrett.org)"

this is going to give me nightmares
lol there’s no winning!
this guy is incredible
estees divertido.
ahora a esperar saber como un enfermo de apendicitis murio por picadura de avispa
beeple-crap.com/
he skyrocketed to over a million followers on ig after a brief mention on the jre podcast not so long ago. he’s very talented but gets a bad rep bc of the “everyday” art persona. i’m a big fan bc his style range is incredible
"he's beeple, bro"
"that’s a hornet, not a wasp. but i guess they all look the same to you!

#insectracism"
lmaooo not sure who would win
oh wait is this you lol


from the creators of sharknado
got my money on corona. new kid in town. youth on its side. doesn't care for the old rules. game changer.
what in the
beeps did it again!
here you go. 
hope this is on #svengoolie tonight!
yup rather similar concepts
"with that being said, other cd artist that are worth checking out are,&"
bruh
um............ wow
"oh ya, that’s right. they sting and they bite. also i hear they bite the heads off honey bees so yeah f those assholes 

#downwithhornets"
ojalá lo de la avispa no sea una catástrofe
i’m so sad that it’s so short
i kinda wanted to see the actual fight
mayweather can be argued (not by me through) as the greatest boxer of all time. who in their right mind would have bet against him in a fight like that.
 i really believe this could happen
"why not, right? everything else awful has happened this year. all we have is the chiefs winning the super bowl, to look back uponwithout total remorse. "
"in the extended cut do they

um

you know

flatten their curves

if you know what i mean"
did you create this? wow.
godzilla still wins.
“give usback”!

i’m opening lines for this bout i got coronavirus at -

and have we looked at putting murder hornets inside the body?
wait til the hurricanes hit


para mí sería un covid vs dengue. espectacular para verlo varias veces lleno de detalles
ccis this how we die?
i want to see that as a movie 
dont matter who wins... we'll be lost...
it looks like corona is saving us from the hornet.
"i wonder how people have the time to work on cool things like this

then i remember
corona"
i can see that earth defence forcewill be epic. edf! edf! edf! edf! #edf #earthdefenceforce
i’d watch this kaiju film

ans then they fuse into wasps that inject the virus right into you
"whoever wins, we lose"
que guapo el dlc de hollow knight
"whoever wins, we lose"
awesome!
is the hornet holding half a person.... the top half? 
whoever wins...we all lose.
where's our savior x æ a-?
wtf am i watching?

:the movie
people really need to calm down lol 
for the first time go corona
i was ready to witness an epic battle
"nah, that's . shortly after mass manufacture of the vaccine."
whoever wins… we lose.
the movie
